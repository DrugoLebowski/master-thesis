This experience in the University and the creation of this thesis were a long e hard paths, that without the support of many people would not be possible.

First of all, I would to thank my parents and all my family for being the best guidance that I could have in my life and my girlfriend Giulia Castellana for his support and for always being by my side.

I would make a big thank you to my Professors and advisor Marco Baioletti and Valentina Poggioni and to my supervisor Gabriele Di Bari for their support in the creation and review of the thesis.

Finally, I would to thank you my friends Simone Cimarelli, Eugenio Paluello, Giammarco Verdini, Lorenzo Ranucci and to all others, which have had a big impact and played a big role in this journey.
