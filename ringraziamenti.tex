First of all, I would to thank my parents and all my family for being the best guidance that I could have in my life and my girlfriend Giulia for her support and for always being by my side.

I would make a big thank to my Professors and advisors Valentina Poggioni and Marco Baioletti and to my supervisor Gabriele Di Bari for their support in the creation and review of this thesis.

Finally, I would to thank my friends Simone, Eugenio, Giammarco, Lorenzo and all the others, which have had a big impact and played a big role in this journey.
