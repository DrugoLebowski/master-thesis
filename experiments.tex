\section{Tasks}
The following are the description of the executed task used in our experiments. All except the last are the same of \cite{NRAM:2016}. In the description, big and small letters represents respectively arrays and pointers, \textit{NULL} denotes the value 0 and is used as an ending character or in the lists, as a placeholder for missing next element.

\begin{itemize}
	\item[1]{\textbf{Access} Given a value $k$ and an array $A$, return $A[k]$. Input is given as $k, A[0], \dots, A[n-1], \textit{NULL}$ and the network should replace the first memory cell with $A[k]$.}
	\item[2]{\textbf{Increment} Given an array $A$, increment all its elements by 1. Input is given as $A[0], \dots, A[n-1], \textit{NULL}$ and the expected output is $A[0] + 1, \dots, A[n-1] + 1$.}
	\item[3]{\textbf{Copy} Given an array and a pointer to the destination, copy all elements from the array to the given location. Input is given as $p, A[0], \dots, A[n-1]$ where $p$ points to one element after $A[n-1]$. The expected output is $A[0], \dots, A[n-1]$ at positions $p, \dots, p+n-1$ respectively.}
	\item[4]{\textbf{Reverse} Given an array and a pointer to the destination, copy all elements from the array in reversed order. Input is given as $p, A[0], \dots, A[n-1]$ where $p$ points one element after $A[n-1]$. The expected output is $A[n-1], \dots, A[0]$ at positions $p, \dots, p+n-1$ respectively.}
	\item[5]{\textbf{Swap} Given two pointers $p, q$ and an array $A$, swap elements $A[p]$ and $A[q]$. Input is given as $p, q, A[0], \dots, A[p], \dots, A[q], \dots, A[n-1], 0$. The expected modified array $A$ is: $A[0], \dots, A[q], \dots, A[p], \dots, A[n-1]$.}
	\item[6]{\textbf{Sum} Given pointers to 2 arrays $A$ and $B$, and the pointer to the output $o$, sum the two arrays into one array. The input is given as: $a, b, o, A[0], \dots, A[n-1], G, B[0], \dots, B[m-1], G$, where $a$ points to first element of A, $b$ points to the first element of $B$, $o$ points to first element of output array and $G$ is a special guardian value. The $A+B$ array should be written starting from position $o$.}
